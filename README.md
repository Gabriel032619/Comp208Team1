This project aims to create a web-based image style transfer tool. 
Users can apply a specific artistic style to their uploaded photos through this platform. 
This project combines deep learning and front-end development techniques with some database knowledge to provide an intuitive and efficient artistic experience. 
Implementing web development techniques and machine learning frameworks is the focus of this project. 
On the frontend, languages such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript combined with the Vue framework can be used to efficiently build user interfaces. 
The backend, which uses Python and MySQL, not only handles images and user requests, but also ensures data security and integrity. 
The core image processing and style transfer functions are implemented through TensorFlow,where the VGG19 model is going to be used to extract and transfer image styles.
